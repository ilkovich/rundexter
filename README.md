Configuration
=============
The SDK should run out of the box with no issues.

Dexter developers can take advantage of several special environment variables:

(new in 0.1.0)

 * DEXTER_API_HOST Defaults to rundexter.com, can be set to any machine name
 * DEXTER_API_HTTPS Defaults to 1, can be set to 0 if DEXTER_API_HOST doesn't support HTTPS
 * DEXTER_API_PORT Defaults to 80, can be set to whatever port the website is running on
 * DEXTER_GIT_HOST Defaults to rundexter.com, can be set to any machine name
 * DEXTER_GIT_PORT Defaults to 22, can be set to whatever port the git server is running on
 
(new in 0.0.1)

 * DEXTER_DEV Defaults to 0, can be set to 1 to see some additional debugging output.  Note that this does not provide any additional functionality to an end user.
